# gallag

I tried to recreate the 1982 game Galaga!

This was my first time trying to build a game in an hour, and I spent a little
too long setting up JavaScript/TypeScript, etc.

Things that took the longest amount of time for me:

* initial dev loop setup
* getting the enemies to sway back and forth without moving off screen

When time ran out, I was trying to:

* make the enemies fly in along a predefined path, while rotating them to be straight
* make the enemies fire shots towards the player, that move diagonally
* make some simple sprites so things aren't just squares
